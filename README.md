# ProjectOiler

This repository includes a directory for every [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) I have solved. At the top of every solution file is the problem description. Most problems are solved using python, some are solved in Go. 

I am in the process of updating my the python2 code used in the earlier problems to python3.
